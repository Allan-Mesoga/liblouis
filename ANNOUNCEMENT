3.27.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release contains support for two more languages, namely Thai and
Romanian uncontracted braille. There is also the usual assortment of
incremental improvements to Bengali, Danish, Hungarian, Swedish, Urdu
and US English. To top it off, some great new contributors did some code
cleanups and bug fixes.

I'd like to thank everybody for helping to bring liblouis forward.

   of just a warning. Thanks to Attila Hammer.
